============================================================================
1. Make Spellstrike (non-expansive) only require a single user input. This should magus feel more fluid but at the same time removing the possibility of "exploits" like TP or jump after a spell to attack a target far away. Of course you can still do it with spellcombat

MOSTLY COMPLETED 2. Add Conflux Spells from Pf2e. Subclass special spells that isn't in any other spell list. Namely: Shielding Strike, Dimensional Assault, Thundering Strike, Shooting Star and Spinning Staff. Those spell will be able to be used once per combat. (like PF2e's focus point systems)

COMPLETE 3. Change Capture Magic arcane cascade to also recharge Conflux spells if you have already used them.

4. Add a class Icon

5. Test and Fix level 13-20 features / Arcanas

6. Add more high level (13-20) Arcanas

7. Change Spell Blending to instead allow Magus to learn scrolls from other classes.

8. Investigate the possibility of "multiple subclass selection" to allow for either Archetypes or Divine/Primal Magus

COMPLETE 9. Rework Twisting Tree's Heal to be more user friendly

COMPLETE 10. Rework Arcane Enhancement (will no longer grant +1, +2, +3 to Attack and dmg rolls to weapon, but will instead change dmg type of weapons)

COMPLETE 11. Rework Knowledge is Power to not make Magus SAD, but instead add int to weapon dmg and no longer require Arcane Enhancement

COMPLETE 12. Rework Cascade Countermeasure to instead allow casting Counterspell with 3AP

COMPLETE 13. Tweak some descriptions (magus' analysis)

COMPLETE 14. Rework Elemental Blade into Elemental Burst
